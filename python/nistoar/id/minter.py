    A IDMinter that creates NOID-compliant identifiers

    NOID stands for Nice Opaque Identifier.  With this convention, identifier

    the letter 'l'.  This convention is intented to maintain identifier 
    opaqueness while avoiding characters that are prone to human transcription 
    errors.  NOIDs may optionally include a single trailing "check character"; 
    this is essentially a 1-byte check-sum of the identifier.  It allows 
    applications to inform users that an unrecognized identifier is actually 
    invalid, possibly due to a transcription error.

        Create the minter

        IDs issued by this minter have a form specified by a template that 
        is defined by the pynoid module.  In general, a template has the 
        following form, expressed as a regular expression:

           (.+\.)?[zrs]?[de]+k?

        The template breaks down into the following components:

           (.+\.) -- This portion represents an optional prefix, minus the 
                     '.' delimiter, that all emitted IDs will start with.  
           [de]+  -- This portion is the core of the pattern and is represented 
                     by a sequence of 'd' and 'e' characters; the total number 
                     specifies the minimal number of characters that will appear 
                     after the optional prefix.  'd' means only a numerical digit
                     will appear in that position; 'e' means that either a digit
                     or a letter can appear.  
           [zrs]? -- The sequence of d/e characters can be preceded by a 'z', 
                     'r', or 's' character.  If this character is a 'z',
                     then the number of characters will appear after the prefix 
                     will be expanded as needed.  Without this 'z', the minter
                     would eventually run out of IDs.  The expanded digits will
                     be of the type given by the first 'd' or 'e' character.  
           k?     -- If the template ends with a 'k' character, the emitted ID
                     will be appended with an extra "check character" (see 
                     description in the class documentation).
